## Research Question
- **Does the type of audit affect the probability of bank failure?**
- External audits provide oversight function for banks beyond regulatory scrutiny
- Interest in the role of auditing in preventing bank failures escalated in late 1980's
- Focus on two audit variables:
  - Traditional audit vs. other assurance types for banks under $500M
  - Integrated vs. financial statement-only audits for banks between \$500M and \$1B

## Significance
- Audit creates:
    - Possible operational efficiencies (Barton, Hodder, & Shepardson, 2025)
    - Additional layer of oversight to compensate for managerial loss of control (Abdel-Khalik, 1993)
    - Potential early warning signal for bank distress (Jin, Kanagaretnam, & Lobo, 2013)
- Banking system stability is crucial to economic health
- Regulatory implications for audit requirements in banking (ICBA, 2025)

## Data Sources
- **FDIC Call Reports**: Quarterly financial data for US banks (2000-2023)
- **Audit Type Data**: RCON6724 from March Call Report (indicates audit type for previous year)
- **FDIC Failed Bank List**: Historical record of bank failures (available from 2001 on FDIC website)

## Bank Failures by Year

\vspace{-0.3cm}
- Financial crisis (2008-2010) shows **significant spike** in failures
- Small banks (<$500M) experienced disproportionate failure rates
- Recent years show relatively few failures in this sample, possibly due to regulatory easing during the covid pandemic.


## Key Variables
```{r}
# Create a sample of the variables and descriptions
variables <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Failurep1", "audit", "integrated", "fsonly", "size", "charge-offs", "npa", "comre", "mortgage", "c&i", "consumer", "capital", "all", "br_ratio", "subchapterS"),
  Description = c("Bank failure in t+1 period (binary)", 
                 "Received any kind of audit (binary)",
                 "Received integrated audit only (binary)(only avilable post-2016)", 
                 "Received financial statement-only audit (binary)(only avaiable post-2016",
                 "Log of total assets",
                 "Net charge-offs to total loans ratio",
                 "Non-performing assets ratio", 
                 "Commercial real estate concentration",
                 "Mortgage concentration",
                 "Commercial and industrial concentration",
                 "Consumer concentration",
                 "Tier 1 capital ratio", 
                 "Allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans ratio",
                 "Brokered deposits ratio",
                 "Subchapter S bank (binary)")
)

knitr::kable(variables, booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9)
```


## Logit Regression Model
- **Binary outcome variable**: Bank failure in period t+1
- **Key predictor variables**: Audit type indicators (audit, integrated, fsonly)
- **Controls**: Asset size, loan portfolio composition and health ratios, capital ratios, etc.

## Model Specification

$$Pr(Failure_{i,t+1}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Audit_{i,t} + \beta_2 Size_{i,t} + \beta_3 Controls_{i,t} + \gamma_t + \delta_j + \epsilon_{i,t}$$

Where:

- $\gamma_t$ represents year fixed effects
- $\delta_j$ represents Federal Reserve district fixed effects


## Regression Results
```{r}
# Create a more comprehensive results table based on your BankFailureAnalysis.R results
results_table <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Audit", "Integrated Audit", "Size", "Charge-offs", "NPA", "Comre", 
              "Mortgage", "Comind", "Cons", "Capital", "ALL", "Brokered Deposits", "Subchapter S",
              "Observations", "Pseudo RÂ²", "Year FE", "FED District FE"),
  SmallBanks = c("-0.563**", "", "-0.414***", "-0.307+", "13.830***", "-1.259+", 
                "1.005", ".452", "-7.123***", "-59.283***", "7.042", "2.008**", "-.182",
                "102,522", "0.575", "Yes", "Yes"),
  LargeBanks = c("", "-.290", "-1.386*", "25.825*", "22.942**", "-1.467", "-2.479**", 
                "5.341*", "-6.1**", "-17.520", "51.287+", "-2.628", "-.922",
                "8,555", "0.267", "Yes", "Yes")
)

# Display the table with styling
knitr::kable(results_table, 
      col.names = c("Variable", "Small Banks (<$500M)", "Large Banks ($500M-$1B)"),
      caption = "Logit Regression Results (Coefficients)", 
      booktabs = TRUE,
      align = c('l', 'c', 'c')) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#800020") %>%
  row_spec(14:17, background = "#f5f5f5", italic = TRUE) %>%  # Highlight model statistics
  add_footnote("Note: *p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01. Standard errors clustered by CERT.", 
               notation = "none")
```

## Key Findings
- Traditional audits associated with **lower failure probability** for all banks < $500M in assets
- For the 2017 - 2022 sample, integrated audits show **no significant association** with failure
- Integrated audit sample suffers from lower # of observations and economic issues which may distort results
- Control variables align with prior banking literature expectations (Jin, et al., 2013a; Beck, Nicoletti, & Stuber, 2022)

## What Did We Learn?
- **Audit reduces probability of bank failure **: Having an audit is associated with a decrease in the probability for faulure in banks < $500M in assets
- **Integrated audit effectiveness inconclusive**: Problems with the data or with the model may have distorted the results
- Banks voluntarily choosing to be audited may have better governance, which may introduce an omitted variable that is difficult to proxy

## Implications
- **Policy considerations**: Proposed change of regulatory threshold for integrated audit to $5B may have little effect on bank failure
- **Early warning signals**: Audit type transitions may signal changing risk profiles
- **Future research**: Considering changes to the integrated audit model to account for economic effects and other omitted variables
