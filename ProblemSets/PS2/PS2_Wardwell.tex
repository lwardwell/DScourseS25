\section*{Data Science Tools}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Measurement:}
        Any time we study something, we measure it. How we measure it effects the outcome.
    \item \textbf{Statistical Programming Languages:}
        Generally grouped into \underline{Compiled} and \underline{Scripted Languages}. Also separated into \underline{Open Source} and \underline{Proprietary}.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item\textbf{Compiled - } Code is run all at once, more painful to write in, once compiled performance is better.
                \item\par\textbf{Scripted - } Code can be run in pieces, more human readable, lower performance.
                \item\par\textbf{Open Source - } Free to use and improved by the community (Examples: R, Python, Julia)
                \item\par\textbf{Proprietary - } Cost to use and maintained by a company (Stata, Matlab, SAS)
            \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Visualization Tools:}
        Usually included with the softwares noted above. Some are better than others at visualization.
    \item \textbf{Big Data Management Software:}
        Used to manage large datasets (Resilient Distributed Datasets) 
    \item \textbf{Data Collection Tools:}
        For example, \underline{Webscraping} - Using an application program interface (API) to download data or downloading HTML files and parsing the text to extract data.
\end{itemize}
